# n4whp-psk

N4WHP-PSK is a digital mode developed by amateur radio operator N4WHP (William Payne), using the Python programming language and employing Phase Shift Keying (PSK) for efficient data transmission. This mode is designed to transmit binary data over HF frequencies using audio waveforms generated by sound cards. With a speed of up to 200 bits per second, N4WHP-PSK offers a balance between rapid transmission and reliable communication, making it faster than many traditional text-based digital modes, such as FT8. By assigning distinct amplitudes to binary values, the modulation scheme allows for clear demodulation on the receiving end, providing a flexible and effective communication tool for amateur radio enthusiasts.

This implementation serves as a proof of concept for several reasons:

* Demonstration of Feasibility: It showcases the ability to transmit digital data over HF frequencies using simple audio waveforms, demonstrating that such a system can work effectively in practice.

* Open to Improvements: While functional, the mode is still in its early stages and can be enhanced further. This includes refining error correction, expanding the protocol to support more complex data types, and optimizing performance.

* Encouragement for Experimentation: It invites other amateur radio operators to experiment with and contribute to the development of the mode, fostering community engagement and collaboration in the exploration of digital communication methods.

* Foundation for Future Development: As a proof of concept, it lays the groundwork for future advancements and more robust implementations that could address various communication challenges in amateur radio.

Operational Considerations: N4WHP-PSK does not support sound cards for all forms of transmission (TX) over RF; a Voice Operated Switch (VOX) is required for TX, while reception (RX) necessitates recording with a phone or similar device. The recorded audio must be converted into a .wav file for demodulation. To ensure proper demodulation, the .wav settings should be as follows:

    Sample Rate: 44100 Hz (standard for audio)
    Bit Depth: 16-bit PCM (to capture sufficient audio detail)
    Mono Channel: Ensure the recording is in mono for simplicity and compatibility with the demodulation process.

By adhering to these specifications, users can effectively receive and decode signals transmitted using the N4WHP-PSK mode.
